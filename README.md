# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Gender Classification Using Hybrid Deep Learning & Machine Learning

---

## 📌 Overview

This project develops an efficient **gender classification system** from facial images using a hybrid approach that combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for deep feature extraction with classical **Machine Learning classifiers** (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost) for the final prediction.

The system is trained and evaluated on the **UTKFace dataset** — a large-scale, real-world facial image dataset with diverse age, race, and gender demographics.

### Hybrid Approach (CNN Features + ML)
| Model | Key Strength |
|---|---|
| SVM | Effective in high-dimensional spaces; robust against overfitting |
| Random Forest | Handles noisy data; reduces overfitting via ensemble voting |
| XGBoost | Gradient boosting; handles missing data; high predictive power |
| Ensemble (Stacking) | Combines base model predictions via a meta-learner |

### Classical ML Baseline
- **LBP (Local Binary Pattern)** features + SVM / Random Forest / XGBoost for comparison

## ⚙️ Method & Approach

1. **Preprocessing** — Images loaded in grayscale, resized to `128×128`, pixel values normalized to `[0, 1]`
2. **CNN Training** — MobileNetV2 fine-tuned with grayscale-to-3-channel conversion layer; sigmoid output for binary classification
3. **Feature Extraction** — Deep features extracted from the **Global Average Pooling (GAP)** layer
4. **Hybrid Classification** — GAP features passed to SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost
5. **Classical Baseline** — LBP handcrafted features used with the same ML classifiers for comparison
6. **Evaluation** — Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC
